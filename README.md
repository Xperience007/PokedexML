# PokedexML
This is an image classifier that was made to classify the original 151 Pokemon. It includes a CNN that I built to train the data and a testing file to test the data as well.

## Tech Used
Python and PyTorch were used in this project. I researched on what to use for a Convolutional Neural Network for an image classifier and created my own CNN and was able to train and test it as well.

## Lessons Learned
I learned about writing CNN's for image classifiers and how to test single images for those classifiers.
